# Bolt Preload Analysis
These programs were developed by the WSU Everett Boeing Scholars team of 2022-2023.
The project involved the investigation of preload loss caused by different environmental factors on several types of bolted joints.
A MATLAB program was developed for creation of an exponential decay model based on data gathered by experiments, while a Python application was developed to utilize the model in a presentable and informative form.

MATLAB application:
app folder: contains alpha prototype application code and resources used for developing the preload decay model.
scripts: contains experimental script files created during early stages of project. These are unused intended as process documenting.

Python application:
source code for an interactable application showcasing different experimental parameters and their effect on preload loss.

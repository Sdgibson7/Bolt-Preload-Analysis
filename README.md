# Bolt Preload Analysis
These programs were developed by the WSU Everett Boeing Scholars team of 2022-2023. Very early in development, completion date aimed at April 2023.
This project will consists of two programs, a MATLAB application for modeling bolt preload loss, and a Python application that makes use of a model to "predict" when maintenance is recommended for the bolt.

For the MATLAB application:
app folder: contains alpha prototype application code and resources.
scripts: contains experimental script files created during early stages of project. These are unused.

For the Python application:

## Running the Program
use the installer located in app\PreloadAnalysisApp\for_redistribution to install the standalone application.
